Vex-Learning-Pushback

This is a learning project for VEX V5, I am using this repository and code to explore, mess around things like this repository.

Includes
- A 6 motor drivetrain.
- Controller analog graph.
- "Half speed".
- A button that does almost nothing. (might be nice for learning)

How to use (unimportant if you know what you are doing)
- The motors are currently setup for the bot that I am currently using.
- The true or false boolian states whether or not the motor is moving in reverse.
- Once you get your ports correct if your drivetrain is mirrored and the motor positions are the same order in your code the boolians should be opposite.
